# Literature overview of water vapour cycling in Ytterbium disilicate Environmental barrier coatings

#Introduction
There’s a limited amount of data due to the recent development of the EBC system in question. Some of the original work on Yb2Si2O7 as a potential EBC system was carried out by Maier et al (2007),  in which the corrosion of Yttrium, Ytterbium and Lutetium in a water vapour environment was investigated. The investigation used sintered powders to produce the desired disilicates which were tested in a high temperature (1500°C) steam environment (70% air/30% water) in the presence of Aluminium based impurities at various intervals (20, 50, 120, 310hrs). The rare earth materials where chosen because previous research had suggested they would not show polymorphism and thus a volume change within the specified temperature range (<1000-1600°C). Ueno et al (2008) also did interesting work.

# Summary
There papers show that the follwing issues are still unknown: oxidation pathways, thermochemcial stability and effect of doping elements.
